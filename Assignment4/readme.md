# GeoStreaming using Apache Kafka producer and consumer with FastAPI and aiokafka 

## What is Apache Kafka?

Apache Kafka is a messaging system with a producer producing a message on the one side and a consumer consuming the message on the other side with a broker (zookeeper) in the middle.

When a producer sends a message, the message is pushed into Kafka topics. 

When a consumer consumes a message it is pulling the message from a Kafka topic. Kafka topics reside within a so-called broker (eg. Zookeeper). Zookeeper provides synchronization within distributed systems and in the case of Apache Kafka keeps track of the status of Kafka cluster nodes and Kafka topics.
